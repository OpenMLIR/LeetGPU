# LeetGPU Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems from [LeetGPU](https://leetgpu.com/challenges). The solutions are written primarily in **Triton** (or specify CUDA/MOJOðŸ”¥) and are categorized by problem. My nickname is [BobHuang](https://leetgpu.com/profile?display_name=BobHuang).

LeetGPU now includes a **solutions feature** within the challenge section. And [AlphaGPU/leetgpu-challenges](https://github.com/AlphaGPU/leetgpu-challenges) has all challenges.

If you're a beginner just getting started with algorithm problems and you're comfortable reading Chinese, feel free to check out my introductory tutorial on Zhihu: ðŸ‘‰ [LeetGPUå…¥é—¨æ•™ç¨‹ (CUDA guideæœ€ä½³å®žè·µ)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1899956367734867434) [LeetGPUçš„MOJO ðŸ”¥ å®žè·µ](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1908980999993402643)

The [OpenMLIR/triton-tutorial](https://github.com/OpenMLIR/triton-tutorial) is a tutorial that uses LeetGPU to get started with Triton. [openMLIR/leetgpu-challenges](https://github.com/openMLIR/leetgpu-challenges) has more Triton solutions.
